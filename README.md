# calculating-inportant-keywards-of-a-corpus-using-tf-idf

<h1>How to run?</h1>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>You need to keep the files "tf_idf.py", "input.csv", "Ngram_Numeric.py" in the same directory.</li>
		<li>The file "input.csv is the corpus whose important keywards are to be calculated."</li>
		<li>Each line of "input.csv" is one document of the corpus. With respective <a href="">usual csv formats</a>, it has only one row. Make sure to take care of common csv mistakes, like not escaping commas.</li>
		<li>The given "input.csv" is a sample of CSV file to test how it works</li>
		<li>After keeping all three files, just run "tf_idf.py"</li>
	</ul>
